## Key features
- ✅Full Gradient Optimization method is considered
- ✅For experimental analysis, two hidden layer and a single output layer is structured.
-   The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
- ✅R-Gaussian activation in each nodes of the hidden layer.
- ✅Linear activation in the output layer
- ✅Uses standard normalized CIFAR data

### Main highlight
- 🚀The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
