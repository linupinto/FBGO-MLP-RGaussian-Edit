# A brief Over view of the programme Rgauss_cifar.py

## Key features
- Full Gradient Optimization method is considered
- For experimental analysis, two hidden layer and a single output layer is structured.
-   The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
- R-Gaussian activation in each nodes of the hidden layer.
- Linear activation in the output layer
- Uses standard normalized CIFAR data

### Main highlight
- The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
