# A brief Over view of the programme Sigmoid_cifar.py

## Key features
- Full Gradient Optimization method is considered
-  For experimental analysis, two hidden layer and a single output layer is structured
-   The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
- Sigmoid activation in each nodes of the hidden layer.
- Linear activation in the output layer
- Uses standard normalized CIFAR data

### Main highlight
-  The code is customized to work on any number of hidden layers and hidden nodes
