# A brief Over view of the programme BN_ReLu_cifar.py

## Key features
- ✅ Implements Batch Normalization with full batch processing
- ✅ Input normalization at each node using moving average and variance
- ✅ Full Gradient Optimization method is considered
- ✅ For experimental analysis two hidden layer and a single output layer is structured in the code.
    - The code  will work on any number of hidden layes and hidden nodes.
- ✅ ReLu activation in each node of the hidden layer
- ✅ Linear activation in the output layer
- ✅ Uses standard normalized CIFAR data

### Main highlight
- 🚀The code is implemented for any number of hidden layers and nodes.
